# DHT22-Wemos
Connecting a DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor to a Wemos Device


Apparently the DHT22 Sensor shield has been removed from the WEMOS store and the DHT11 is now listed as retired in favor of the new DHT12 board. I assume to bring into line now that you can use I2C as opposed to the older format. I will update this code when I get a chance to get my hands on a DHT12 or a AM2320 or AM2322.
